## Filter Types
- (1) One type of filter is a frequency-selective circuit that separates the radar signal from its background based on the signal frequency spectrum. Filters of this type are referred to as frequency(-selective) filters, classified as low-pass, high pass, bandpass, or band-stop filters. Depending on the center frequency, tuned filters are divided into radio-frequency (RF, or microwave) filters, intermediate-frequency (IF) filters, or video filters, and, depending on bandwidth, into narrowband or wideband filters. These are used primarily in the radar receiver.
- (2) A second type of filter is a two-port device providing a required output based on its input signal. In this sense it is a major component of the radar signal processor. An optimum filter (which is termed a matched filter for a background of white noise) gives the highest signal-to-noise ratio at its out put, for given input signal energy. Signal processing filters are divided into analog, discrete, and digital filters (Fig. F21), based on the representation of input and output signals, and into linear and nonlinear filters based on the equations linking the input and output signals.The basic equation describing the operation of a modern radar filter is the discrete filter equation (see linear filter). Digital filters have considerable advantage over analog fil ters, and are most commonly used in modern radar signal processors. They are implemented as tapped-delay-line filters and are classified as recursive (infinite impulse response, or IIR) or nonrecursive (finite impulse response, FIR, or transversal) filters. The latter type is most widely used.
- (3) This type of filter is an algorithm processing a set of individual estimates (e.g., radar measurements obtained over successive time periods) with the objective of obtaining a new estimate for time tn. If tn is equal to or less than the current time tj when the last measurement is made, the operation is termed smoothing (or interpolation); if tn > tj, it is termed prediction or extrapolation. The two basic types of filter performing these operations are the α-β(-γ) filter and the Kalman filter.
## Adaptive Filter
- An adaptive filter is one that changes its parameters on the basis of current information to obtain a performance optimum in a certain sense under initial uncertainty and changing oper ating conditions. Input signal S(n) is filtered or weighted in an adaptive filter (1) to obtain output signal y(n), which then is compared with useful, standard, or training signal to find error signal ε(n) (see Fig. F22). The error signal is used with adaptation algorithm (2) for adjustment of the weighted factors of the filter parameters (usually using an integrative method) for gradual minimization of the error (or of another cost function).
- Adaptive filters require a minimum volume of initial information concerning the arriving signal. Gradient methods (see ALGORITHM, Widrow, and CANCELER, How ells-Applebaum) usually are used to control filter weight parameters. IIR and FIR filters with realization in both the time and the frequency domains are used as adaptive filters.
## Analog Filter
- An analog filter is one using analog circuit technology. Depending on the required filter response and its operating mode, an analog filter may be the simplest electronic circuit or a complex device. Analog filters are divided into the fol lowing types: filters using oscillating or aperiodic circuits, using phase and dispersive circuits; and filters using delay lines. Each type usually is used for filtering of a specific class of signals in matched processing and to obtain a different type of frequency responses (see Table F2).![[Pasted image 20241129141420.png]]
## AR Filter
- An autoregressive filter is an all-pole filter in which parame ters of an observed N-point data sequence are modeled as those of white noise passed through a filter with N − 1 poles.
## Filter Characteristics
- In general form an arbitrary filter can be represented as a two-port device (Fig. F25) with an input signal x(t) and output signal y(t), having spectra Sx(f ) and Sy(f ). The fundamental characteristics describing its opera tion in the time and frequency domains are the filter impulse response h(t) and the filter transfer function H(jω). The impulse response is the time response to an impulse input (δ function).
## Coherent integration Filter
- A coherent integration [comb] filter is a narrowband filter at IF or baseband that is matched to a specific target doppler frequency and whose response repeats at the pulse repetition frequency. Typically this repeated (comb) response is obtained by range-gating the input signal at the input to a nar rowband filter. In search and target acquisition radar modes, a filter bank covering all doppler frequencies within the pulse repetition frequency interval is usually implemented (by fast Fourier transform or similar techniques) to detect a target at any velocity. This filter bank is an essential part of the mov ing target detector or pulsed doppler types of signal process ing. In tracking radars and homing seekers, a single filter (or velocity gate) may be used, tracking the target doppler fre quency. Coherent integrating filters are necessarily doppler sensi tive, the passband of each filter being inversely proportional to the integration time. The difficulty in direct synthesis of comb filters in the frequency domain leads to the approach in which the signal is sampled in range gates (or with range strobes, for digital filters), before passing into a bandpass fil ter or bank of such filters.
